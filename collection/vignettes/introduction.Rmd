## Goals

- Interactive work with data sets/objects
- Deferring work to remote host(s)
- Distributing work accross a cluster


## Interactive

Repository: archive, collection, ...

Archivist - CRAN package
archive - local implementation of this concept

collection - a distributed data frame (yet another); SparkR? dplyr? what other approaches are possible?

## Deferring

Pack the main entry point (function or code) and its dependencies,
serialize and send to a remote host. Unserialize and re-build the
dependencies so that the main entry function/code can be run in a
remote environment without any changes to the code.

Package: defer

```{r eval=FALSE}
Rserve(port = 12345, args = c('--vanilla', '--RS-enable-control'))
x = RS.connect(port = 12345)
RS.assign(x, 'x', 0)
RS.eval(x, { Sys.sleep(3); x <- x + 1; x}, wait = F)
RS.collect(x, timeout = 0)
RS.server.shutdown(x)
RS.close(x)
```



## Distributing

Collection - splitting a data set into multiple parts that can be
  processed (selected, filtered, grouped) and passed to computational
  algorithms (modelling and scoring);
  multiple approaches are possible, with various backends (SparkR,
  simple filesystem + Deferred Task)

Other projects like that in R:

- ff: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ff/index.html http://ff.r-forge.r-project.org/
- ffbase: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ffbase/index.html
- bigmemory: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bigmemory/index.html
- depending on bigmemory: bigtabulate, biganalytics
