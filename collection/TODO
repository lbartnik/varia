* fix this (random) error:
   ply result - with 1 error(s):
   1:  subscript out of bounds in .subset2(x, i, exact = exact) 

* replace underlying collection object
  it is a character vector now, but it should be a data_frame;
  it will then allow for arranging, filtering, grouping and
  joining collections, as long as the tags are there

* process function objects in function environments in package_()
  serializing functions means storing their environments as lists,
  but then more functions might be present in these environments
  and they are not processed in any way right now

* add object tracing: store function used to generate object in
  a special collection in a repository and add a special tag which
  will tell how the object was created (in addition to .src* tags)

* errors contain too much details and grow into GB of data
