* fix this (random) error:
   ply result - with 1 error(s):
   1:  subscript out of bounds in .subset2(x, i, exact = exact) 

* replace underlying collection object
  it is a character vector now, but it should be a data_frame;
  it will then allow for arranging, filtering, grouping and
  joining collections, as long as the tags are there
